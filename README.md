To start a new year...

1. cd to this root directory
2. run `dotnet new console -lang "F#" -o src/aoc2023`
3. run `dotnet sln add src/aoc2023/aoc2023.fsproj`
4. copy the `main` mechanism from a previous year's Program.fs to this year's Program.fs
    - subject to change in the future, this is kind of disgusting lol
